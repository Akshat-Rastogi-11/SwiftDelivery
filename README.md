# Swift

Nowadays, due to global pandemic, it is quite difficult for people to move out of
their homes frequently, which has changed the consumers habits and has taken
them to the e-commerce platform for purchase of daily necessities.

Thereby, we have put in efforts in developing anandroid application(completely in
**JAVA** ) in order to deliver grocery items from wholesalers and retailers to the
doorstep of consumers.

This Project was created for Object Oriented Programming Course.

## #Functionalities

### ● Registration

We have provided the registration feature for the new user where the user
has to enter the username, email and password for creating the account.

The User can also login from their Google or Facebook accounts, withthe
location of the user taken directly through the Google maps api and an
email would be sent to the user’s email after successful registration.

The Registered User can login to their account by entering their username, 
email address and password and will be sent to their
consumer/retailer/wholesaler accounts based on their registration details.

The User can access the Shopping categories, Help and support, Ordersplaced 
and Items in Cart from the navigation drawer. From the main screen, the user can
