# Swift

Nowadays, due to global pandemic, it is quite difficult for people to move out of
their homes frequently, which has changed the consumers habits and has taken
them to the e-commerce platform for purchase of daily necessities.

Thereby, we have put in efforts in developing anandroid application(completely in
**JAVA** ) in order to deliver grocery items from wholesalers and retailers to the
doorstep of consumers.

This Project was created for Object Oriented Programming Course.

## #Functionalities

### ● Registration

We have provided the registration feature for the new user where the user
has to enter the username, email and password for creating the account.

The User can also login from their Google or Facebook accounts, withthe
location of the user taken directly through the Google maps api and an
email would be sent to the user’s email after successful registration.

The Registered User can login to their account by entering their username, 
email address and password and will be sent to their
consumer/retailer/wholesaler accounts based on their registration details.

### ● Dashboard(Consumer)

The User can access the Shopping categories, Help and support, Ordersplaced 
and Items in Cart from the navigation drawer. From the main screen, the user can 
select the category to select the grocery product that they want to buy and add it 
to the cart with the required quantity.

Then they can go to Cart from the floating button or navigation drawer to check the added 
items, confirm the order and track the status of the order. They can give feedback on the 
service on the Help and Support tab.


### ● Dashboard(Retailer)

The Retailer can add the new products for the consumer to purchase, or
make an order from the wholesaler if the stock gets over.When adding the 
product, the retailer can add the image, description and price of the product.

and delivery details and can change the order status to “Shipped” and “Delivered”.

They can refill their stock by purchasing and placing orders to the Wholesalers in the 
similar method.


### ● Dashboard(Wholesaler)

Wholesaler’s home has the option to add products for sale to the retailers and 
to see the pending orders by the retailers.
These products will be exclusive for retailers at the wholesale price and for 
large quantities.
In the Pending-Orders button, Wholesalers will be able to see the products in 
the order, total amount and shipping details.
