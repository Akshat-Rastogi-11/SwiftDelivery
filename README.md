# Swift

Nowadays, due to global pandemic, it is quite difficult for people to move out of
their homes frequently, which has changed the consumers habits and has taken
them to the e-commerce platform for purchase of daily necessities.

Thereby, we have put in efforts in developing anandroid application(completely in
**JAVA** ) in order to deliver grocery items from wholesalers and retailers to the
doorstep of consumers.

This Project was created for Object Oriented Programming Course.
